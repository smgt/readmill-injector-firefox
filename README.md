# Firefox Add-On - Readmill Injector

This is the repository of the Firefox plugin that injects 'Send to Readmill' buttons on webpages that includes EPUB files.
You can find the [Add-On over at Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/readmill-injector/).

## Readmill

Readmill is a service that manages your EPUB books and supplies a wonderful iPad application for reading them. You can read

Currently the only supported webpage is [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org). But as more services becomes known I will
add them.
